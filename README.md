# Uncertainty-Modeling-of-Wind-and-Solar-Power Using MATLAB

This repository contains MATLAB scripts for uncertainty modeling of a 5 MW wind turbine and a 5 MW solar plant using the Weibull and Beta probability distribution functions, respectively. The purpose of these scripts is to simulate and analyze the uncertainties associated with renewable energy generation, specifically focusing on wind and solar power. For a comprehensive theoretical understanding of the methodologies used in these scripts, please see the following paper:
